In this section, the basic concepts behind automated test suite generation and mutation analysis are discussed as they relate to this paper.

\subsection{Automated Test Suite Generation}
Due to the high cost and inconsistencies introduced when developing test suites by hand, automatic test suite generation research is on the rise.  In the past, the writing of test cases was left as an afterthought, and their generation was the responsibility of a separate quality assurance team rather than the developer.  This led to a disconnect between the code and the tests.  In recent years, however, there has been a move towards a more involved test development system in tandem with the the development process ~\cite{Gelperin:1988:GST:62959.62965}.  This movement includes focus on creating unit tests for code as its developed to ensure that code always passing tests thereby improving the quality of the code ~\cite{Canfora:2006:EAT:1159733.1159788}.  Although this improvement in test generation processes successfully increased the reliability of the code, the cost of time and effort to manually write high quality test cases increases as programs became more complex~\cite{clarke1998automated}. 

To assist in the writing of test cases in an automated way,
