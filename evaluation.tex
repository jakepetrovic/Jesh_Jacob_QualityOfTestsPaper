\subsection{Key Evaluation Goals}

We are interested in the following research questions.

\textbf{Q1.} Do automated generated unit tests retain the same quality as manually written unit tests?

\textbf{Q2.} What is the cost of time and effort difference in using automated tests versus manually written tests?

\textbf{Q3.} Can developers learn to manually write JUnit tests better with the help of automated generated suites?

\textbf{Q4.} Do mutation scores and coverage correlate in any way?
