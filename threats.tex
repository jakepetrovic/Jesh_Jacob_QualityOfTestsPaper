\subsection{Threats to Validity}
Measurements in quality of software tests is a subjective measurement. Although mutation score is one way to measure the quality of a test suite, ignoring the human elements of tests are nigh impossible. Developers may need to view tests in order to diagnose faults in the code, and if a developer cannot understand the test they are reading, then the cost of time and effort could be increased on the human part.

The statistical analysis also may be a threat to validity, as the inconsistency in how both Evosuite and manually written tests are created. Also, CodePro generated some test suites with a mutation score of 0, which could mislead one to believing that CodePro has no use for creating quality tests. For this reason we removed these results to give a better impression of the trend CodePro test suites.
