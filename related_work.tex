There are few studies comparing the quality of manual and automated test suites. In one study researchers found that using automated test generation tools did not improve the ability to test the software ~\cite{Fraser:2013:AWT:2483760.2483774}. However, the study does not measure the quality of manual and automated generated test suites directly. Furthermore, only Evosuite is used to evaluate the mutations and generate the tests. This paper expands upon the question of the usefulness of automated generated test suites, and if certain systems in generating test suites work better than others.
