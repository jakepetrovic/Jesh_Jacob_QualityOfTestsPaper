\section{Introduction}
Software testing is a vital task throughout the software development lifecycle for helping to create quality software.  However, the creation and execution of tests is also one of the most expensive components of software development, \textcolor{red}{often comprising of  to \% of the total lifecycle}~\cite{}.  Traditionally, test cases are written manually by the code developers or a quality assurance team.  Unfortunately, manual creation of a high quality test suite requires large amounts of thought, time, and effort. Although manual creation gives developers control over what code is tested and how thoroughly different sections of code is tested,  the cost of the time and effort required to produce these test suites can be extremely high in large projects.  As an alternative to manually writing test cases, many automatic test case generation tools are now available to assist developers in testing code.  However, the quality of the test suites produced by these tools varies, and it is unclear how the test suites of automatic test generation tools compare to those that are manually developed.

%Manual Generated Tests -  benefits vs drawbacks
When manually generating test cases, developers, given time, are able to spend more effort to improve the quality of a test suite to ensure it captures the full depth of the code.  Test focus may vary depending on the developer and project goals/business rules.  Some developers may write tests with the goal of increasing the code coverage, particularly in terms of statements or branches.  Others may focus tests on ``important'' code or code that they expect will be most commonly executed.   In either case, as the program complexity rises, manually writing test cases can become expensive, requiring more thought and labor, when applied to highly complex features~\cite{clarke1998automated}.

An additional challenge in developing test suites is that there is no strict standard or guideline for writing test cases.  Without a standard, test cases are often written inconsistently or subjectively.  While goals or company policy may drive the sections of code that developers attempt to test, the ability of test suites to find bugs is not frequently analyzed.

%Talk about auto generated test suites - benefits vs drawbacks
On the other hand, automatic test case generation tools have been developed to reduce the time and cost of developing a test suite, and some algorithms, in theory, can be used to help improve particular business goals such as coverage or bug finding ability.  Many automatic test suite generators currently exist.  Some are extremely basic, setting up a simple skeleton for methods such as \textcolor{red}{`getters' and `setters' alone}\cite{}.  \textcolor{red}{Others will create slightly more sophisticated skeletons for tests (describe and cite).}  Finally, tools such as CodePro AnalytiX, Palus, TestEra, and Evosuite can generate full, executable test suites that need no modification prior to execution~\cite{Fraser:2011:EAT:2025113.2025179, Zhang:2011:PHA:1985793.1986036, Marinov:2001:TNF:872023.872551, codepro}.  

%Compare Automated vs Manual
Automatic test case generation tools use deterministic algorithms to produce test cases based on particular goals, removing the subjectivity and styles one may find in manually generated tests.  They also significantly reduce the amount of time and effort required of the developer to create the test suite.  However, 


%What we do
In this paper, we analyze existing manually written test suites of open source applications and compare these to test suites that are generated using a two automatic test case generation tools, CodePro and Evosuite.
